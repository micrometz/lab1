1.)	When you replace the “const MyClass ccc = cc;” with “MyClass ccc ;” you get 
Foo
Foo
2.)	The constant member function makes it so you cant change the variable. You call it by const
3.)	You can just use cout but its best to keep std:: before that because it is a global namespace 
4.)	In the first code its doesn’t have std:: but it look like to calls a function for the input then prints input vs the other one look for the input then prints it no functions involved 
5.)	When ran I get Radius is:5.5 and Area is:94.985 and when you run the code for the other one you get error that the radius is private and not declared
